# file: hangman.py is a program that (allows the user to select their own word size and number of lives in the game hangman)
# input: (the input asks for the user's preferred word size (3-12), and preferred number of lives (out of 10). It then asks the user for a letter one at a time.)
# output: (If the user guesses the correct letter, the letter will be shown, but if the user guesses incorrectly, they will lose a life as shown by the "X")
